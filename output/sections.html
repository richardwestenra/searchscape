<p>App indexing is the process which allows your app’s content to appear in mobile search results if it is relevant to the searcher’s query. The result would link directly to that content “view” within the app, using “deep linking”. At the moment the main player in app indexation is Google, but other search services such as Apple Spotlight are implementing processes to do this for their search results as well.</p>
<p>Deep linking is simply the name of the process that enables a user to be directed deep into an app via a link from another app or a web page, rather than simply being directed to the opening screen of that app and having to navigate on their own from there.</p>
<p>The main reason app indexing and deep linking are becoming such a major part of search, is that standard web crawling extends poorly to apps, which have been traditionally seen as ‘<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2541/walled-garden-technology">walled gardens</a>’. The introduction of deep linking, including the ability to support HTTP deep links for in-app content has seen app indexation become a viable process for search engines.</p>
<p>The importance of these two topics will continue to grow. For example, Google has just released <a href="http://marketingland.com/google-app-streaming-web-of-apps-152449">app streaming</a> testing, which allows for a seamless journey between web and app, by negating the need to download the app in the first place.</p>

        <h2 id="compound-queries-in-60-seconds">Compound queries in 60 seconds</h2>
<p>A compound query is the process of submitting a search query and receiving an answer from Google, then immediately submitting another query, whereupon Google takes cues from your first search to provide you with a better answer. </p>
<p>There are two aspects to compound queries. One is query revision. For example, if you said ‘show me cookbooks’ in your first query, the revised query would previously have been ‘show me vegetarian cookbooks’. In the compound query model, you could simply say ‘show me the vegetarian ones’.</p>
<p>The other is chained queries, which work in a similar way, but when you’ve performed your initial query, you ask a second question on the same topic. For example if you first asked ‘how tall is the Empire State Building?’, you could follow that with a chained query, such as ‘When was it built?’. You’re not revising your query, but it is dependant upon having asked the first query.</p>
<p>We’re currently only seeing this in <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2940021?hl=en">conversational search</a>, but we expect it to migrate to desktop in the future. Compound queries are hugely important for the young generation of seachers who’ve never been trained to search in a keyword-oriented way.</p>

        <h2 id="implicit-queries-in-60-seconds">Implicit queries in 60 seconds</h2>
<p>Users of Google have long been used to the idea that the words and phrases typed into the the search box would correlate directly to web pages that would appear in the search results. Over time, this has become less true, up to the current point where it’s almost never true. So, if this time-honoured process isn’t happening, what is? Implicit queries.</p>
<p>As Google has become more sophisticated, it’s began to take into <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/dashboard">more and more factors</a> into your search, which you as a user never explicitly say or type. These are called the implicit parts. These can include the likes of what device you&#39;re using, your location, search history, mode of transport and more.</p>
<p>The mean reason this has recently become a more prominent trend and will, we believe, continue to do so, is down to Google simply having more data points. This is primarily due to the amount of smartphone users. Google is also getting better at understanding these data points.</p>
<p>In the near future Google will almost certainly continue to give further weighting to the implicit signals of your search query. Google Now on Tap is an example of this process happening right now. It will be exciting to see how far implicit queries can go.</p>

<p>While site speed is far from a new topic - it’s been a ranking factor for some time, as well as an integral UI consideration - there are a number of reasons that the importance of site speed will begin to increase.</p>
<p>Site speed at it’s simplest is how fast your site loads. As users have become used to much faster internet speeds, they’ve also become accustomed to slick, lightning-fast web experiences. While we, as marketers, might not be expected or able to directly fix site speed, we can be measuring things to help spot areas that can be improved.</p>
<p>Tools like <a href="http://urlprofiler.com/">URLProfiler</a> to run Google Page Speed test en-masse across your site. Running comparisons against major competitors can help create a good benchmark for the kind of performance you can expect from your site. </p>
<p>There are also a number of technologies on the very near horizon that you can be reading up on in preparation. We’ll begin to see a number of server-side enhancements, like <a href="https://http2.github.io/">HTTP/2</a>, which will improve download speed. In addition, <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project</a> is due to go public in 2016, and is aimed at making it easier to build fast mobile websites.</p>

<p>The classic ‘10 blue links’ is practically a thing of the past. Of the <a href="http://mozcast.com/features">10,000 SERPs that Moz keeps track of</a>, only 3% are purely organic results. The other 97% contain a multitude of other SERP features including images, news results, local packs, the knowledge box, the knowledge graph and so much more. It’s constantly changing and evolving.</p>
<p>The UI of the Google SERP is fundamental to a digital marketer’s work, and so it is important to understand what you can do to put your brand or your client’s brand in the best position to appear in these various SERP features. </p>
<p>One thing you should definitely be considering and implementing is <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema Markup</a>, which you can put into the code of your website to provide much more detailed info to search engines. Google directly uses Schema information to create certain SERP features. </p>
<p>Looking to the future the prevalence of paid listings in the SERPs is growing dramatically. We’ve seen instances of four text ads above the first organic result, along with a number of shopping results. Google Search is increasingly becoming pay to play. </p>
